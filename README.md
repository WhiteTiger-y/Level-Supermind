# **NovaLens: A Futuristic Social Media Engagement Analytics Platform**  

## **Project Overview**  
NovaLens is a cutting-edge social media engagement analytics platform that utilizes AI workflows and cloud database infrastructure to analyze and optimize content performance. This project is designed to empower businesses, influencers, and content creators by providing real-time, data-driven insights into how various post formats—such as reels, carousels, and static images—perform across social media platforms.  

With Langflow for workflow automation and DataStax Astra DB for secure and scalable database management, NovaLens delivers a futuristic, user-friendly solution for social media strategy optimization.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Mock Database Creation**: A custom mock dataset simulating social media metrics (likes, shares, comments, views) was created and uploaded to Astra DB for analysis.  
- **Dynamic Querying**: Post types can be selected as input (e.g., reels, carousels), enabling tailored queries to fetch specific engagement metrics from the database.  
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Integration with GPT models through Langflow to generate actionable insights like:  
  - “Carousel posts have 20% higher engagement than static posts.”  
  - “Reels drive 2x more comments compared to other formats.”  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Astra DB for seamless handling of large-scale datasets.  
- **Future-Proof Design**: Highly customizable workflows to extend functionality for more advanced analytics and additional metrics.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Langflow**: For creating AI-powered workflows.  
- **DataStax Astra DB**: For storing and managing the engagement dataset.  
- **OpenAI GPT (via Langflow)**: For generating intelligent insights based on queried data.  
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and integration.  

## **Project Workflow**  

1. **Database Setup**  
   - A mock dataset was created to simulate social media metrics, including attributes such as:  
     - Post Type: Carousel, Reels, Static Images  
     - Engagement Metrics: Likes, Shares, Comments, Views  
   - The dataset was then uploaded to Astra DB, a cloud-based Cassandra database, for efficient querying and scalability.  

2. **Workflow Design**  
   - Using Langflow, a workflow was constructed to process input dynamically.  
   - The "Data Fetcher" tool queries Astra DB for engagement metrics based on the selected post type.  
   - The data is passed to a GPT-powered node to generate actionable insights.  

3. **Insights Generation**  
   - The system dynamically calculates average engagement metrics and generates insights such as comparisons between post types or identifying the most effective content format.  

4. **Visualization and Output**  
   - The results are displayed in the chat interface as user-friendly insights, helping users quickly adapt their social media strategies.  

## **How to Use**  

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - A DataStax Astra DB account (free-tier is sufficient).  
   - Langflow installed locally or accessed through its web version.  
   - Python environment for custom script execution.  

2. **Setup Instructions**  
   - Clone this repository:  
     ```bash  
     git clone https://github.com/WhiteTiger-y/Level-Supermind.git  
     cd NovaLens  
     ```  
   - Install dependencies (if required):  
     ```bash  
     pip install -r requirements.txt  
     ```  
   - Import the mock dataset into your Astra DB instance.  
   - Configure your Astra DB credentials in the project.  

3. **Run the Workflow**  
   - Open Langflow and upload the workflow file (`NovaLens_Flow.json`).  
   - Connect the required tools such as "Data Fetcher" and GPT-based "Agent."  
   - Provide the desired post type as input (e.g., "carousel").  
   - Run the workflow to generate insights.  

## **Sample Output**  
Example insights generated by NovaLens:  
- "Carousel posts generate 30% more shares compared to static images."  
- "Reels have the highest average likes per post, driving 2x more comments than other formats."  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Integration with live social media APIs for real-time data analysis.  
- Advanced sentiment analysis on post comments.  
- Predictive modeling for engagement trends based on historical data.  
- Visualization dashboards for engagement metrics.
